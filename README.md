These notebooks shows how to perform clustering and dimensional reduction. With clustering, both linear and non-linear types are shown, using data created by `make_blobs` and `make_moons` from scikit-learn. KMeans and DBSCAN clustering methods are shown, along with details on how to select the hyperparameters for DBSCAN algorithm. The dimensional reduction is performed on image data, which is obtained from `fetch_olivetti_faces` module from scikit-learn. The ways to check how many principal components are optimal to reconstruct the image after performing dimensional reduction is also shown.
For whatever reasons, an error is encountered while attempting to preview the notebooks. However, when downloaded, all looks fine.
